Variable Naming in CEA
==========================

This guide provides information about the files generated by the CEA. The files generated by CEA are saved
in the following location ``<SCENARIO>\outputs\data``. In this folder, there are individual folders
corresponding to ``demand``, ``optimization``, ``potentials``, ``solar-radiation``, ``uncertainty``. These folders
are generated during every successful run corresponding to the function, i.e. ``demand`` folder is generated
when ``CityEnergyAnalyst\cea\demand\demand_main.py`` file is run.

The variable ``<SCENARIO>`` is used throughout this document to reference the path to a CEA scenario folder, e.g. the
folder ``baseline`` in the sample reference case shipped with the CEA.

The variable ``<BUILDINGNAME>``  is used throughout this document to reference the name of a single building in the
scenario.
