How to create a new release?
============================

This section describes the steps necessary to create a new release of the City Energy Analyst (CEA).

Versioning
----------

Each release of the CEA needs a version number. Version numbers need to increase for PyPI_. The relevant documentation
for python version numbers is documented in PEP440_. The CEA uses the following versioning scheme in compliance with
PEP440_:

    major.minor[.revision][pre-release]

Major and minor version segments in this scheme refer to the milestone (sprint) the release was developed for. The
major version segment works on roughly a yearly time scale while the minor version segment tracks sprints inside the
major release. Each such pair (major.minor) refers to a "milestone" in the `GitHub issues milestones list`_.

If a release needs to be updated after publishing, an optional revision can be used, starting at 1 and incrementing.

During the sprint, the pre-release section is used to represent the current state of the master branch. At the beginning
of the sprint, alpha versions are used. Examples: 2.2a0, 2.2a1, 2.2a2, etc. In this phase the issues belonging to the
milestone are being added.

Once the code base settles down, beta versions can be used. Examples: 2.2b0, 2.2b1, 2.2b2, etc. In this phase, new
features should not be added anymore and instead testing / bug fixing activities should dominate.

Before releasing a milestone, the release candidates can be used. Examples: 2.2rc0, 2.2rc1, 2.2rc2, etc. In this phase
the software is just being tested with show-stopping bugs being fixed if possible.

Where to find the current version number
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The current version number can be found in the module :py:mod:`cea` (actually, since :py:mod:`cea` is a package, you
need to look into the file ``__init__.py``) in the variable ``__version__``.
All code requiring knowledge of the current version number should read the version from here. In python modules this can
be achieved by:

.. source: python

    import cea
    version_number = cea.__version__


The NSIS installer (see section `Creating the installer`_) uses the helper tool
``setup/get_version.exe`` to extract the version and write it to the file ``setup/cea_version.txt`` - if importing
:py:mod:`cea` is not an option, you could explore this avenue too...


Responsibility for version numbers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The repository admin merging a pull request to master is responsible for updating the version number.

Update the CREDITS.md file
--------------------------

For each minor release (2.2, 2.3, ...) the ``CREDITS.md`` file needs to be updated to include all the authors that
worked on that release.


Creating the installer
----------------------

- first, make sure you have the Nullsoft Scriptable Installation System (NSIS) installed. See :doc:`how-to-set-up-nsis`
- if the dependencies changed, you need to re-create the ``Dependencies.7z`` file and store it as a binary on the
  release.

  - Be sure to update the URL to ``Dependencies.7z`` in the file ``setup/cityenergyanalyst.nsi`` to the new release
  - To create the ``Dependencies.7z`` file, follow these steps:

    - create an empty folder called ``Dependencies``
    - locate the conda environment for the CEA (as created with ``environment.yml`` and copy it to the ``Dependencies``
      folder.
    - rename the environment folder to ``Python``
    - use the 7z_ program to compress the ``Dependencies`` folder to ``Dependencies.7z``

- create the installer by right-clicking ``setup/cityenergyanalyst.nsi`` in Windows Explorer and choosing the "Compile
  NSIS Script" option.
- upload the installer to the Release page.
- update the document :doc:`installation-on-windows` to refer to the newest installer.

Testing in a virtual machine
----------------------------

In order to test the release, it is a good idea to run the installation guide / installer on a clean virtual machine,
e.g. with VirtualBox_. This test should go as far as running `cea test --reference-case open` just to be sure everything
is still working. This test goes a bit further than the regular test in that it makes sure the installation instructions
still work on a new installation. This is important because it can find missing packages in the dependency lists etc.

Building the documentation
--------------------------

Well documented code is an essential part of the release, allowing your code's legacy to only grow in glory and admiration.
The documentation will be rendered via the readthedocs_ site, allowing future developers, practitioners, researchers and students
to understand and build upon your work. Note: entry points created by the command ``cea install-toolbox`` should be run at least once
and you also need to install GraphViz_ to produce the graphs.

CEA uses sphinx_ to document all module code, and has a tool specific to documentation to make your life a little easier. Simply run via the command
line once the cea virtual environment is activated in conda: ``activate cea``::

``cea-doc html``

This will remove, rebuild and open any change files, allowing you to check how the documentation htmls were rendered. Please address any
errors (red text) which appears during the sphinx build. For more information, check out the :doc:`how-to-document-cea`.

Finally, any changes to the conda environment need to be reflected in the ``docs/environment.yml`` file and if your code writes any new output variables or files,
the ``schemas.yml`` should be updated accordingly.

Uploading to PyPI
-----------------

- check long-description with this commandline::

    python setup.py --long-description | for /f %i in ('where rst2html.py') do python %i > %temp%\ld.html && start %temp%\ld.html

  - make sure the output is valid / no errors, as this will be the text of the CEA on PyPI
  - for ``rst2html.py`` to be installed, you will need to do a ``pip install sphinx``

- delete any old distributions from dist folder (you can just delete the whole ``dist`` folder if you like)

- do ``python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel``

  - this will recreate the ``dist`` folder with two files that look similar to these:

    - cityenergyanalyst-2.2-py2-none-any.whl
    - cityenergyanalyst-2.2.tar.gz

- use twine to upload to PyPI

::

    twine upload dist/*

  - you can get twine_ with ``pip install twine``
  - the command above assumes you have set the ``TWINE_PASSWORD`` and ``TWINE_USERNAME`` environment variables
    if not, use the ``--username`` and ``--password`` positional arguments
  - ask the repository admins for username and password
