Installation guide for Windows
==============================

Follow these instructions to install the CityEnergyAnalyst (CEA) on a Windows system (tested with Windows 10).

.. attention:: We advise to follow the above guide precisely:

        *   Be sure to **USE** ``conda env create`` **NOT** ``conda create`` familiar to experienced conda users.
            This command not only creates an environment, but also reads the ``environment.yml`` file, containing a
            list of packages (and versions) to install, as well as a definition of the channels to check.
        *   If you need to create a conda environment for the CEA that has a specific name (the default is ``cea``) then use the
            ``name`` parameter: ``conda env create --name your-env-name-here``


Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~


* Download and install `Git (64-bit) <https://git-scm.com/download/win>`__.
* Download and install `Github Desktop (64-bit) <https://desktop.github.com/>`__.
* Download and install `Miniconda(64-bit) for Python 2.7 <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`__.

   .. note:: UNCHECK the "Register Anaconda as my default Python 2.7" option as ArcGIS integration
      will not work otherwise.

* Download and install `Pycharm Community edition (64-bit) <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows>`__ OR your own favorite editor.
* Download and install `Daysim <https://daysim.ning.com/page/download>`__.
* Download and install `ArcGIS Desktop 10.5 or 10.6 <https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/get-started/installation-guide/introduction.htm>`_ (requires a licence).
    * An `Esri account <https://www.arcgis.com/home/signin.html>`_ must be created to buy and download ArcGIS Desktop, located in Products: All Products.
    * ETH affiliates are advised to access ArcGIS via the ETH IT Shop.
* Download and install the `ArcGIS Desktop Background Geoprocessing (64 Bit) <https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/analyze/executing-tools/64bit-background.htm>`_.

    .. note:: ArcGIS (with Background Geoprocessing) is required to run the thermal network layout script.
        Otherwise, ArcGIS is only used for visualisation purposes.
