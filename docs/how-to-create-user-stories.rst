User Stories
============

User stories define WHAT, WHY and for WHOM we aim to solve a new bug or implement a new feature.
This helps our Project Owner to better prioritize issues around CEA.

We have a standard yet simple way to define these user stories. This guide walks you on how to define your first user story.

Step 1. define an USER
-----------------------

At CEA we count with four (4) potential USERs for creating an user story. These are key groups of users we want CEA to serve.
The first step in creating a new story is to select a end-user from the next list.

#. Researcher or Contributor: A member of the CEA research team or network of contributors.
#. Student or practitioner: An active user of CEA.

Step 2. define the NEED
------------------------

Think about the NEED you have. Is it about a bug problem/bug or rather about a new feature you want to be implemented?
It is important that you think about the NEED from the point of view of the END-USER (first person).

Step 3. define the WHY
----------------------

Now think about why the END-USER needs that NEED.

Step 4. put it the story together
---------------------------------

Now put ti all together. For this kindly use the next structure:

**As a** USER **I want to** NEED **so I can** WHY

Here is an example:

:USER: Researcher
:NEED: know how to define user stories
:WHY: = can add new bugs and features to the pipeline of CEA

The result will be the Title of your user story:

**As a** Researcher **I want to** know how to define user stories **so I** can add new bugs and features to the pipeline of CEA.

One more example:

:USER: Student
:NEED: understand how the dynamic tool works
:WHY: = can use CEA more effectively

The result will be the Title of your user story:

**As a** Student **I want to** understand how the dynamic tool works **so I** can use CEA more effectively.


Step 5. submit a new user story
-------------------------------

Now it is time to submit a new user story in CEA. For this:

1. Go to the CEA repository in Github.
2. Click `New Issue`
3. in Title, add the name of the user story
4. Finally, in description, give a more detailed description of the problem.
5. In the description you can directly connect to other user stories using *#* or connect to other people using *@* in the text.
