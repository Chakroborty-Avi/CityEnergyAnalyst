The Configuration File
======================

The City Energy Analyst uses a configuration file for storing user preferences. User preferences
are inputs to simulation runs like what weather file to use, what scenario to use and script-specific inputs.

When you first run the ``cea`` tool (e.g. with ``cea install-toolbox`` during the installation process), the default
configuration file is copied to your home folder.

On Windows systems, the home folder is usually something like ``C:\Users\YourUserName``, so the configuration file
would be stored in ``C:\Users\michelle\cea.config``, assuming that your username is ``michelle``.
