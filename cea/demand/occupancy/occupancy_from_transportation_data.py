def calc_schedules_from_transportation_data(locator, dates, use_stochastic_occupancy):
    """
    Calculates the schedule for a building using MATSim data when available. When MATSim data is not available, the same
    procedure from `cea.occupancy.calc_schedules` is used.

    The schedules are normalized such that the final demands and internal gains are calculated from the specified
    building properties and not the archetype values. Depending on the value given to `stochastic_occupancy` either the
    deterministic or stochastic model of occupancy will be used.

    The script generates the following schedules:
    - ``people``: number of people at each hour [in p]
    - ``ve``: ventilation demand schedule normalized by the archetypal ventilation demand per person [in (l/s)/(l/p/s)]
    - ``Qs``: sensible heat gain due to occupancy normalized by the archetypal gains per person [in W/(Wp)]
    - ``X``: moisture gain due to occupants normalized by the archetypal gains per person [in (g/h)/(g/p/h)]
    - ``Ea``: electricity demand for appliances at each hour normalized by the archetypal demand per m2 [in W/(W/m2)]
    - ``El``: electricity demand for lighting at each hour normalized by the archetypal demand per m2 [in W/(W/m2)]
    - ``Epro``: electricity demand for process at each hour normalized by the archetypal demand per m2 [in W/(W/m2)]
    - ``Ere``: electricity demand for refrigeration at each hour normalized by the archetypal demand per m2 [W/(W/m2)]
    - ``Ed``: electricity demand for data centers at each hour normalized by the archetypal demand per m2 [in W/(W/m2)]
    - ``Vww``: domestic hot water schedule at each hour normalized by the archetypal demand [in (l/h)/(l/p/d)]
    - ``Vw``: total water schedule at each hour normalized by the archetypal demand [in (l/h)/(l/p/d)]
    - ``Qhpro``: heating demand for process at each hour normalized by the archetypal demand per m2 [in W/(W/m2)]
