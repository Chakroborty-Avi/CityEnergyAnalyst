REM generate the dot file by running the demand script on the nine cubes test case
REM (the dot file is placed in the ..\docs\demand folder under the name "demand-module-overview.gv")
REM %~dp0 resolves to the full path of the folder in which the batch script resides.
if not exist "%~dp0..\docs\demand" mkdir %~dp0..\docs\demand
call python create_function_graph.py --module-overview --output %~dp0..\docs\demand\demand-module-overview.gv

REM generate the .pdf file by running the `dot` program
REM (the resulting pdf is placed in the ..\docs\demand folder under the name "demand-module-overview.gv.pdf")
call dot -Tpdf -O %~dp0..\docs\demand\demand-module-overview.gv
